## Design Philosophy

### User-Centered Design
- Start with user needs, not technology
- Design with users, not for them
- Test early and often with real users
- Iterate based on feedback and data
- Consider diverse user abilities and contexts
- Solve real problems, not imagined ones

### Core UX Principles
- **Clarity**: Make the interface immediately understandable
- **Consistency**: Use patterns users already know
- **Feedback**: Respond to every user action
- **Efficiency**: Minimize steps to accomplish goals
- **Forgiveness**: Allow undo and prevent errors
- **Discoverability**: Make features findable
- **Control**: Let users feel in command

## User Research

### Research Methods
- **User Interviews**: Understand needs, goals, pain points
- **Surveys**: Gather quantitative data at scale
- **Usability Testing**: Watch users interact with designs
- **Analytics**: Track behavior and identify patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Compare design variations
- **Card Sorting**: Understand mental models
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Observe users in their environment

### Creating User Personas
- Base on real research, not assumptions
- Include goals, needs, pain points, behaviors
- Keep focused (3-5 primary personas)
- Update as you learn more
- Use to guide design decisions

### User Journey Mapping
- Map current state (as-is) and future state (to-be)
- Include touchpoints, emotions, pain points
- Identify opportunities for improvement
- Consider the entire user lifecycle
- Involve stakeholders in the process

## Interaction Design

### Designing Flows
- Start with user goals
- Minimize steps to completion
- Provide clear paths forward
- Handle errors gracefully
- Show progress for multi-step processes
- Allow easy navigation back
- Save user progress

### Information Architecture
- Organize content logically
- Use clear, descriptive labels
- Create shallow hierarchies (3-4 levels max)
- Group related items together
- Make search and navigation complementary
- Consider user mental models

### Microinteractions
- Provide immediate feedback for actions
- Use loading states for async operations
- Animate state changes smoothly
- Make interactive elements obvious
- Use hover states and cursor changes
- Provide haptic feedback on mobile

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

### Perceivable
- Provide text alternatives for images (alt text)
- Provide captions for audio/video
- Ensure color contrast ratio 4.5:1 (AA) or 7:1 (AAA)
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Make text resizable up to 200%
- Avoid auto-playing audio

### Operable
- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Give users enough time to read content
- Avoid seizure-inducing flashing (3 flashes/second)
- Provide skip links for repetitive content
- Use descriptive link text ("Learn more about pricing" not "Click here")

### Understandable
- Use clear, simple language
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make pages appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes
