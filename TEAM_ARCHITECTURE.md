# Agent Team Architecture

This document describes the balanced 6/6 agent team based on Jungian psychology principles for optimal motivation and innovation.

## Team Balance: Worker Agents (Execution) ↔ Governance Agents (Quality & Direction)

## Team Dynamics

### Worker Agents (Execution Layer)
- **Focus**: Building, implementing, fixing
- **Psychology**: Sensing (practical, concrete, detailed)
- **Output**: Code, infrastructure, solutions

### Governance Agents (Quality & Direction Layer)

#### Strategic Governance (Intuition)
- **Product Owner**: What to build, why it matters
- **System Architect**: How to structure it

#### Technical Governance (Thinking)
- **Code Reviewer**: Is it well-written?
- **Security Auditor**: Is it secure?
- **Test Writer**: Does it work correctly?

#### Human Governance (Feeling)
- **UX Designer**: Does it serve users well?

## Key Relationships

| Worker Agent | Primary Governance Partners |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Frontend Specialist | UX Designer, Code Reviewer |
| Backend Specialist | System Architect, Security Auditor |
| Database Designer | System Architect, Code Reviewer |
| DevOps Engineer | System Architect, Security Auditor |
| Full-Stack Developer | All Governance Agents |
| Debugger | Code Reviewer, Test Writer |

## Balance Principles

1. **6 Workers + 6 Governance = Complete Team**
2. **Thinking (4) + Feeling (2) = Balanced Decision Making**
3. **Execution (6) + Direction (2) + Quality (4) = Sustainable Delivery**
4. **Technical Focus + User Focus = Valuable Products**
